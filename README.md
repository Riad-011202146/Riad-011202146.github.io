# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

This is a paragraph.

Using two asterisks **this text is bold**.  
Two underscores __work as well__.  
Let's make it *italic now*.  
You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.  
Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.
What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?

> This is a blockquote.
> Want to write on a new line with space between?
>
> > And nested? No problem at all.

> > > PS. you can **style** your text _as you want_.
